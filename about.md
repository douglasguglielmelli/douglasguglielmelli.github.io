I have a multidisciplinary background, strong project management skills and a passion for data and analytics. With work experience in the private and public sectors, I distinguished myself by showing a problem-solving attitude and always strived to provide actionable insights. I have experience with relational databases and statistical modeling and my goal as a professional is to simply help people make better decisions.
